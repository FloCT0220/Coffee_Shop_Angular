2. If we add a new size (e.g., Short or Trenta), how would your app adapt?
- Add a new column for the new drink size
- Have all the drink size and price be put into a json array under a size collumn

3. How would you extend your app to allow adding “condiments” (like pearl, grass jelly, whipped cream)?
